# Data Science

## Introduction to Data Science

### Definition
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that leverages scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.

### Significance
1. **Informed Decision Making**: Data Science enables organizations to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
2. **Predictive Analysis**: It allows for the prediction of future trends and outcomes.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns and correlations within data for a deeper understanding.
4. **Optimizing Processes**: Improves efficiency and effectiveness by optimizing processes through data analysis.
5. **Competitive Advantage**: Provides a competitive edge by uncovering hidden opportunities and risks.

## Linear Algebra for Data Science

### Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors

- **Scalars**: Single numerical values.
- **Vectors**: Ordered arrays of numbers.
- **Matrices**: 2D arrays of numbers.
- **Tensors**: Generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions.

### Operations in Linear Algebra

1. **Scalar Multiplication and Addition**: Multiply or add a scalar to a matrix.
2. **Matrix Multiplication**: Dot product of matrices.
3. **Transpose**: Swapping rows and columns of a matrix.

### Problem 1:
Perform scalar multiplication on the matrix \\(A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\\) with the scalar \\(k = 3\\).

**Solution:**
\\[ kA = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 9 \\ 12 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \\]

### Problem 2:
Given matrices \\(B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 \\ 3 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(C = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\\), calculate the product \\(BC\\).

**Solution:**
\\[ BC = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 11 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \\]

## Linear Equations

### Definition
A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a variable.

### Standard Form
\\[ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n = b \\]

### Solving Linear Equations
- **Substitution Method**: Solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other.
- **Elimination Method**: Eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting equations.
- **Matrix Method**: Represent the system of equations as a matrix and solve.

### Problem 3:
Solve the system of equations:
\\[ 2x + y = 8 \\]
\\[ 3x - 2y = 1 \\]

**Solution:**
Multiplying the first equation by 2 and adding the second equation, we get \\(7x = 9\\), leading to \\(x = \frac{9}{7}\\). Substituting \\(x\\) back, we find \\(y = \frac{5}{7}\\).

### Problem 4:
Express the following linear equation in standard form:
\\[ 4x - 2y + 6z = 10 \\]

**Solution:**
Rearranging the given equation, we get:
\[ 4x - 2y + 6z - 10 = 0 \\]

## Distance

### Euclidean Distance
\\[ d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - y_i)^2} \\]

### Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm)
\\[ d(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_i| \\]

### Minkowski Distance
\\[ d(x, y) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_i|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \\]

### Problem 5:
Calculate the Euclidean distance between points \\(P(2, 5)\\) and \\(Q(7, 1)\\).

**Solution:**
\\[ d(P, Q) = \sqrt{(7-2)^2 + (1-5)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 16} = \sqrt{41} \\]

### Problem 6:
Determine the Manhattan distance between vectors \\(V = [2, -3, 5]\\) and \\(W = [1, 4, -2]\\).

**Solution:**
\\[ d(V, W) = |2-1| + |-3-4| + |5-(-2)| = 1 + 7 + 7 = 15 \\]

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### Definition
- **Eigenvalues (\(\lambda\))**: Scalar values that represent how a linear transformation changes.
- **Eigenvectors (\(v\))**: Vectors that remain unchanged in direction after a linear transformation.

### Calculation
\\[ Av = \lambda v \\]
where \\(A\\) is a square matrix.

### Problem 7:
Given a matrix \\(D = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\\), find its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors.

**Solution:**
The characteristic equation leads to \\(\lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 5 = 0\\), with solutions \\(\lambda_1 = 1\\) and \\(\lambda_2 = 4\\).

For \\(\lambda_1 = 1\\), solving \\( (D - I)v = 0\\) gives \\(v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\\).

For \\(\lambda_2 = 4\\), solving \\( (D - 4I)v = 0\\) gives \\(v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\\).

## Dimensionality Reduction

### Motivation
- **Curse of Dimensionality**: Increasing dimensions may lead to sparsity and computational challenges.
- **Feature Selection and Extraction**: Retain important information while reducing dimensionality.

### Techniques
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Linear transformation to convert data into a new coordinate system.
2. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: Non-linear technique for visualizing high-dimensional data.

### Problem 8:
Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset with 4 features to 2 dimensions.

**Solution:**
1. **Compute Covariance Matrix**: Calculate the covariance matrix of the dataset.
2. **Find Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**: Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
3. **Sort Eigenvectors by Eigenvalues**: Sort the eigenvectors based on their corresponding eigenvalues.
4. **Select Top \(k\) Eigenvectors**: Choose the top \(k\) eigenvectors to form the transformation matrix.
5. **Transform Data**: Multiply the original data by the transformation matrix to obtain the reduced-dimensional data.

## t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

### Problem 

9:
Explain the motivation behind using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and provide a step-by-step overview of the t-SNE algorithm.

**Solution:**
t-SNE is motivated by the need to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving local relationships. Here's a step-by-step overview:

1. **Define Pairwise Similarities**: Compute pairwise similarities between data points in the high-dimensional space using a Gaussian distribution.
2. **Define Pairwise Similarities in Low-Dimensional Space**: Compute pairwise similarities in the low-dimensional space using a Student's t-distribution.
3. **Optimization**: Minimize the difference between the pairwise similarities in the high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces using gradient descent.
4. **Visualization**: Map the data points to the lower-dimensional space for visualization.
